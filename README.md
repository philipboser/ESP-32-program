Firmware for Smart Lock
====================

This is the firmware used in our smart lock. It runs on the ESP 32  and is programmed in C on with ESP-IDF.

Please check [ESP-IDF docs](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/index.html) for getting started instructions.

I will be adding a teamviewer link to connect to a remote environment with the ESP-IDF installed and an ESP-32 microcontroller connected  in the near future to be used as a sandbox for development.
